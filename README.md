Subject: Login System Activity 
Technologies: Django,Python, Html , CSS 
Description:-This is my first Django login system, in this the user will first sign up and only if the email and password is set in sign up 
             ,than User will be able to login and will be redirected to the dashboard .
Procees of project:First of all we have to create a folder, in that folder we will download the django project, for that the command is 
                   ---django-admin startproject projectname  
                   After the project is created, run the project fpr that command is 
                   ---python manage.py runserver
                   After running the server, if your project is run successfully in the command prompt, a IP address will be generated which 
                   will be pasted in the URL in any browser and the project will run.
                   After that we can make changes in our project folder by opening it in any text editor.
Thank you
